What is Discovret?

Discovret is a bridge app from the real world to the metaverse. We are passionate about incentivizing real world experiences and social interactions that will enhance the users experience inside of the metaverse. Right now, we are soley focused on creating layer one, a platform that allows the user to discover the real world and people around them in a fun interactive way. Later on, we will add the second layer of the app, which will be the bridge to the metaverse. Our culture and community is built upon three guiding principles, Discover, Understand, and Uplift. We encourage this culture by taking the user through those three principles throughout their experience in the app.

We are about halfway done with completing development of layer one of the app. Currently, we are working on map and geofence integration into the app.
